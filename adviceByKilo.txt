Task Completed
Perfect! I've implemented a cascading AI provider fallback system for your quiz application. Here's what you now have:

âœ… Multiple AI Providers with Automatic Fallback
Free Options (Recommended First):
ðŸ†“ Ollama (Local AI) - Completely free, runs on your machine

No API keys needed
No internet required once downloaded
Best for privacy and cost
ðŸ†“ Together AI - Free tier with generous limits

API key required but has free credits
Fast and reliable
ðŸ†“ Hugging Face - Free inference API

API key required
Good for various models
Paid Options (Fallback):
ðŸ’° Gemini - Your current setup (occasional outages)
ðŸ’° OpenAI - Most reliable but paid
ðŸ”„ How the Fallback System Works:
Try Ollama â†’ Try Together â†’ Try HuggingFace â†’ Try Gemini â†’ Try OpenAI â†’ Static Data
Automatic: Set VITE_AI_PROVIDER=auto and it tries providers in order
Manual: Set VITE_AI_PROVIDER=ollama to force a specific provider
Graceful: If all AI providers fail, falls back to your static questions
ðŸš€ Quick Setup for Free AI:
Option 1: Ollama (Best Free Choice)
# Install Ollama (one-time)
curl -fsSL https://ollama.ai/install.sh | sh

# Download a model (one-time)
ollama pull llama3.1:8b

# Start Ollama service
ollama serve
Then update your .env:

VITE_AI_PROVIDER=auto
VITE_OLLAMA_MODEL=llama3.1:8b
Option 2: Together AI (Cloud Free)
Sign up at together.ai
Get your API key
Update .env:
VITE_AI_PROVIDER=auto
VITE_TOGETHER_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
ðŸŽ¯ Benefits:
âœ… Always Works: Static questions as final fallback
âœ… Cost Effective: Free options tried first
âœ… Reliable: Multiple providers prevent single points of failure
âœ… Smart: Automatic provider selection
âœ… User-Friendly: Shows loading states during generation
Your quiz will now generate fresh AI questions when possible, and seamlessly fall back to static questions when needed. The system is much more robust than relying on a single AI provider!
